# Wake Me Up: Motorized Alarm Clock
MITES Electronics Final Project

At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) summer program MITES 
(Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science), a 6-week rigorous, summer, 
residential, enrichment program for rising high school seniors, I participated 
in the Electronics elective class. As my final project, my classmate and I 
designed, built, and programmed a motorized alarm clock using a RaspberryPi 
and Python. We were awarded the "Best Electronics Final Project." The Wake Me Up 
Motorized Alarm Clock is an alarm clock that plays preloaded songs or alarms 
while the car-like device simultaneously moves at the user's set alarm time. 
The song/alarm, movement pattern of the vehicle, and the alarm time are all 
customizable by using the LCD interface and buttons directly below. The file 
included here contains the code for our alarm clock.
